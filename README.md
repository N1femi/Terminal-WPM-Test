# Terminal-WPM-Test

This is one of my beginner projects, developed to build proficiency in python and syntax understandings.

- Color Coded (Green For Accuracy, Red for Inaccuracy)
- Beginner Friendly (In my opinion)
- Will not run pleasently in GUI-Type Enviornment (like Pycharm)
- This is a Terminal Project
  
## Steps to Run Successfully
1. Open local Terminal
2. Navigate Terminal to Directory
3. Type `python3 main.py` and ENTER
4. Have Fun!



## Dependencies!!
There were some imported libraries I used in this project
- **time**: was used for calculating WPM
- **curses**: foundation of this system(normally comes with the python language pre-installed)
- **random**: used for randomizing content for the user to type
